======================

Tools/Scripts to analyse the Freebase dumps.

* **`python-sketches`**: Here are simple scripts to extract some rough data and place it in CSVs. These results are not deemed to be correct or fully capture the wanted data but good to get an inside of what's available and what needs to be done in more complex scripts.
* **`artist-locations`**: A collection of scripts to extract all artists from freebase and compute the country of origin.
